## 2 Creating project

Open Epic launcher and launch UnrealEngine. Goto `New Project`, under Blueprint (It is a node based approach where you don't have to write an code) tab click on `First Person`. Make sure there are no Starter contents (i.e. rocks, land etc...). Change the location of your project and file name to suit your needs. Once all the primary configurations are done, click on `Create Project`.
